    """Basic test case for publishing in Photoshop

        Uses generic TestCase to prepare fixtures for test data, testing DBs,
        env vars.

        Always pulls and uses test data from GDrive!

        Opens Photoshop, runs publish on prepared workile.

        Then checks content of DB (if subset, version, representations were
        created.
        Checks tmp folder if all expected files were published.

        How to run:
        (in cmd with activated {OPENPYPE_ROOT}/.venv)
        {OPENPYPE_ROOT}/.venv/Scripts/python.exe {OPENPYPE_ROOT}/start.py runtests ../tests/integration/hosts/photoshop  # noqa: E501
